# mit_ai_labs_6034
Lab codes required by MIT Course Number 6.034

# Motivation:

I am a bit of a dinossaur from the old times when 5-inches-floppy disks were the absolute maximum you could get in term of technology.

So I always wanted to make a AI course, but never got the time to do it. I know AI is an old topic, but as I always wanted to do it, here is my grain of salt for those looking for 'inspiration' should someone like me would require a peek of somebodyelse's labs' solution in order to get back on track ans complete their assignments.
