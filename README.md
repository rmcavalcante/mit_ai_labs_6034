# mit_ai_labs_6034
Lab codes required by MIT Course Number 6.034

# Motivation:

I am a bit of a dinosaur from the old times when 5-inches-floppy disks were the absolute maximum you could get in term of technology.

So I have always wanted to make an AI course, but never got the time to make it happen. I know AI is an old topic, but that's in my bucket list. 

This is my grain of salt for those looking for 'inspiration'.

I hope these codes will help you to get back on track and complete your assignments.
